FunCoin
=======

FunCoin is an experimental simplified cryptocurrency designed to explore and exhibit cryptocurrency concepts in a simple, presentable fashion. It is currently being developed by Randy Van Why, Rob Kelly, and Sean Turner as a class project for CSE 441 Cryptography and Applications at NMT.

FunCoin is a great name for a great cryptocurrency.
